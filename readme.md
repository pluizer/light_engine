## What?
A very simple, light and fast 2d engine. Written in C and specially crafted to be easily wrapped for other languages.

## Why?
I like experimenting with many different languages by making little games in them. Many of those languages lack good libraries/engines to do this. Wrapping an existing library can often proves to be too difficult/frustrating just for an experiment. That is why I made /light_engine/ which is trivial to use in any language that supports calling C-functions.
